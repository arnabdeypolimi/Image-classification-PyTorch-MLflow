# Image-classification-PyTorch-MLflow

The repository contain code for image classification using PyTorch. I have also used MLflow to track the experiments. The code is a modified version of the PyTorch [fine-tune](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html) tutorial.
This code has features like MLflow, Confustion matrix generation, and Model saving.

This repository only contain the code for training the models. Data pre-processing and dataset creation code is not present in the repository but can be added in future on request. 

## Dataset folder structure should be:
    .
    ├── dataset        
        ├── Train            
            ├── Class Name             
                  ├── Sample name            
        ├── Val               
            ├── Class Name             
                  ├── Sample name
