# Image-classification-PyTorch-MLflow

The repository contain code for image classification using PyTorch. I have also used MLflow to track the experiments. The code is a modified version of the PyTorch [fine-tune](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html) tutorial.
This code has features like MLflow, Confustion matrix generation, and Model saving.
